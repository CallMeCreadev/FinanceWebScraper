WebScraper to pull data from [open insider](http://openinsider.com/), Yahoo Finance, and [stockNinja](https://www.stockninja.io/).
Options Extract has been removed from the main execution path as the website https://maximum-pain.com/ is frequentlly down and unresponsive.
Options Scraper is now included which pulls the same data using StockNinja.

Data is formatted specially to take the week, month or quarter value from the past compared to present and creates a ratio between the values.
You will need to modify the formatting if you want to do something else with it.
